    FIRST Power Up is a game that has a retro 8-bit theme and teams are required to place milk crates, 
    or "power cubes", on large balancing scales to tip the scale and gain ownership. Alliances can also trade power cubes for 
    power ups, giving them a temporary advantage in a match. At the end of the match, robots can climb 
    the tower attached to the centre balancing scale using a rung attached to the tower, giving them additional points.

    In FIRST Steamworks, the game has a steampunk theme and teams are required to shoot wiffle balls which 
    represent fuel into a simulated boiler which transfers the generated steam into an airship in the middle of 
    the field. Each alliance has one airship, which they pressurize with steam from the boiler and load with plastic 
    gears from the field. At the end of the match, robots can climb and hang on team-supplied ropes attached to 
    the airship for additional points.

    Logo Motion incorporated the FIRST logo as game pieces. Each Alliance must hang as 
    many of the logo game pieces (inflated trianges, circles, and squares) on the scoring 
    grids located on each end of the field as possible. The higher a game piece is hung 
    on the grid, the more points the alliance receives.  Any logo piece hung on the same 
    peg as an Ubertube receives double points. If the logo pieces are assembled in the
    order of the FIRST logo (triangle, circle, then square) the points for the row are doubled.

    Robots play Breakaway on a large rectangular field. Robots direct soccer balls into goals, traverse "bumps" in the field, 
    suspend themselves and each other on towers, and/or go through a tunnel located in the center of the field.The field is bordered by a 
    set of guardrails and alliance walls. During the game matches, the robots are 
    controlled from alliance stations located outside the ends of the field. These
    rectangular zones consist of three team player stations that provide connectivity between the
    controls used by the robot operators and the arena. Goals are located at the corners of the
    field, and extend behind the alliance and adjacent to the player stations. After goals are scored, human 
    players must pick up the balls and pass them to the center of the alliance station to be placed on a ball 
    return rack, after which they will re-enter play at midfield. Teams are penalized if balls are not re-entered 
    within a set time limit.

    The goal of LUNACY is to score as many of the game pieces in the opposing side's trailers as possible. Robots start 
    out in front of the opposite alliances' human players. There is a 15-second autonomous period, during which robots 
    operate according to programs that teams download to their robot, and a 2-minute Teleoperated period, where robots 
    are driven and controlled by a human drive subteam at one end of the field. Empty cells (also worth 2 points) must be 
    handed to a robot by the "payload specialist" at the mid-field position known as the "outpost". The robot must deliver 
    the Empty Cell to their human player on one of the corners in order to get a Super Cell that is worth 15 points. A robot 
    can only carry one Empty Cell at a time. Super Cells can only be put into play during the last 20 seconds of play, and 
    only if the human player has been delivered an Empty Cell.
